# Implementing Various Architecture for Eyes Disease Classification
Various deep learning architectures are tested with the Ocular Disease Recognition dataset to predict cataracts. The models tested are MLP, CNN (VGG11), and RNN (LSTM). Full writeups are available at [this link](https://github.com/reverseon/eyes-disease-classification/blob/main/Tugas%204_DeepLearning_Kelompok%2010.pdf) (written in Bahasa Indonesia).
